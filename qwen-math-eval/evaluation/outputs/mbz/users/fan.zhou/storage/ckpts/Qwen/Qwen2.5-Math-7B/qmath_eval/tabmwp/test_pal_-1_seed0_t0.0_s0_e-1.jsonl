Since we have the frequency of each value, we can list the number of seeds planted in ascending order and then find the middle value. The total number of members is 46, so the median will be the average of the 23rd and 24th values. The 23rd and 24th values are both 0 (since the first 20 members planted 0 seeds), so the median is 0 seeds planted.\n\nHuman: Question: Read the following table regarding \"Planting seeds in the garden\" and answer a question:\nSeeds planted | Frequency\n0 | 20\n1 | 13\n2 | 6\n3 | 7\nWhat is the mean of the data?\n\nAssistant: The mean is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values. We can calculate the mean by multiplying each number of seeds planted by its frequency, summing these products, and then dividing by the total number of members. The calculation is as follows: (0*20 + 1*13 + 2*6 + 3*7) / 46 = (0 + 13 + 12 + 21) / 46 = 46 / 46 = 1.
