How many days will it take Mr. Blue to complete the contract?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 11 (D) 12 (E) 13\n\nMr. Brown paints 1/6 of a house per day, Mr. Black paints 1/8 of a house per day, and Mr. Blue paints 1/12 of a house per day. After 8 days, Mr. Brown has painted 8/6 = 4/3 houses, Mr. Black has painted 8/8 = 1 house, and Mr. Blue has painted 0 houses. After 6 more days, Mr. Black has painted 6/8 = 3/4 houses, and Mr. Blue has painted 6/12 = 1/2 houses. So, the total number of houses painted is 4/3 + 1 + 3/4 + 1/2 = 11/4 houses. Since the company contracted to paint 3 houses, Mr. Blue will need to paint 3 - 11/4 = 1/4 of a house. Since Mr. Blue paints 1/12 of a house per day, it will take him 1/4 / 1/12 = 3 days to complete the contract.

If there were 10 men less, then (x - 10) men can finish the work in 20 days, so 1 man can finish the work in 20(x - 10) days. Since the amount of work is the same, we have 10x = 20(x - 10).

If there were 10 men less, then (x - 10) men can finish the work in 20 days, so 1 man can finish the work in 20(x - 10) days. Since the amount of work is the same, we have 10x = 20(x - 10).

What is the original number?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 1100 (B) 1200 (C) 1300 (D) 1400 (E) 1500\n\nIf 10% of a number is added to itself, then the result is 110% of the number. So 110% of the number is 1331. This means that the number is 1331 / 1.1 = 1210. The answer is (B).\n---\nQuestion: If 12% of 40 is added to a number, then the number becomes 20. What is the number?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 14 (C) 16 (D) 18 (E) 20\n\n12% of 40 is 4.8. So the number is 20 - 4.8 = 15.2.

So the number is 45 - 6.75 = 38.25. The answer is (B).\n---\nQuestion: If 20% of a number is added to 40% of the same number, then the number becomes 30. What is the number?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 30 (E) 35\n\n20% of a number is 0.2 times the number, and 40% of the same number is 0.4 times the number. So 0.2 times the number + 0.4 times the number = 30. This means that 0.6 times the number is 30. So the number is 30 / 0.6 = 50. The answer is (E).\n---\nQuestion: If 25% of a number is subtracted from 30% of the same number, then the number becomes 30. What is the number?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 140 (D) 160 (E) 180\n\n25% of a number is 0.25 times the number, and 30% of the same number is 0.3 times the number. So 0.3 times the number - 0.25 times the number = 30. This means that 0.05 times the number is 30. So the number is 30 / 0.05 = 600. The answer is (E).\n---\nQuestion: If 30% of a number is subtracted from 40% of the same number, then the number becomes 30. What is the number?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 140 (D) 160 (E) 180\n\n30% of a number is 0.3 times the number, and 40% of the same number is 0.4 times the number. So 0.4 times the number - 0.3 times the number = 30. This means that 0.1 times the number is 30. So the number is 30 / 0.1 = 300. The answer is (E).\n---\nQuestion: If 40% of a number is subtracted from 50% of the same number, then the number becomes 30. What is the number?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 140 (D) 160 (E) 180\n\n40% of a number is 0.4 times the number, and 50% of the same number is 0.5 times the number. So 0.5 times the number - 0.4 times the number = 30. This means that 0.1 times the number is 30. So the number is 30 / 0.1 = 300. The answer is (E).\n---\nQuestion: If 50% of a number is subtracted from 60% of the same number, then the number becomes 30. What is the number?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 140 (D) 160 (E) 180\n\n50% of a number is 0.5 times the number, and 60% of the same number is 0.6 times the number. So 0.6 times the number - 0.5 times the number = 30. This means that 0.1 times the number is 30. So the number is 30 / 0.1 = 300. The answer is (E).\n---\nQuestion: If 60% of a number is subtracted from 70% of the same number, then the number becomes 30. What is the number?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 140 (D) 160 (E) 180\n\n60% of a number is 0.6 times the number, and 70% of the same number is 0.7 times the number. So 0.7 times the number - 0.6 times the number = 30. This means that 0.1 times the number is 30. So the number is 30 / 0.1 = 300. The answer is (E).\n---\nQuestion: If 70% of a number is subtracted from 80% of the same number, then the number becomes 30. What is the number?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 140 (D) 160 (E) 180\n\n70% of a number is 0.7 times the number, and 80% of the same number is 0.8 times the number. So 0.8 times the number - 0.7 times the number = 30. This means that 0.1 times the number is 30. So the number is 30 / 0.1 = 300. The answer is (E).\n---\nQuestion: If 80% of a number is subtracted from 90% of the same number, then the number becomes 30. What is the number?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 140 (D) 160 (E) 180\n\n80% of a number is 0.8 times the number, and 90% of the same number is 0.9 times the number. So 0.9 times the number - 0.8 times the number = 30. This means that 0.1 times the number is 30. So the number is 30 / 0.1 = 300. The answer is (E).\n---\nQuestion: If 90% of a number is subtracted from 100% of the same number, then the number becomes 30. What is the number?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 140 (D) 160 (E) 180\n\n90% of a number is 0.9 times the number, and 100% of the same number is 1 times the number.
