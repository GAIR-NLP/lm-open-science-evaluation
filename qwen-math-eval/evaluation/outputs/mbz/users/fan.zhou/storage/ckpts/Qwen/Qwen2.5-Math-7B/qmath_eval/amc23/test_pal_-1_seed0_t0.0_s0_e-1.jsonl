A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices, and each vertex is connected to 5 others. The possible distances between any two vertices are 1, 2, or 3, as the longest path between any two vertices does not exceed three edges.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios for $d(Q, R)$ and $d(R, S)$:\n- If $d(Q, R) = 1$, then $Q$ and $R$ are directly connected by an edge. In this case, $d(R, S)$ can be 1, 2, or 3. However, for $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ to be true, $d(R, S)$ must be 1, which is not possible since $Q$, $R$, and $S$ are distinct.\n- If $d(Q, R) = 2$, then $Q$ and $R$ are connected by a path of two edges. For $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ to be true, $d(R, S)$ must be 1. This is possible if $S$ is directly connected to $R$ but not to $Q$.\n- If $d(Q, R) = 3$, then $Q$ and $R$ are connected by a path of three edges. For $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ to be true, $d(R, S)$ can be 1 or 2.\n\nTo find the probability, we need to count the number of ways $Q$, $R$, and $S$ can be chosen such that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ and divide it by the total number of ways to choose three distinct vertices from the 12 vertices of the icosahedron.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose three distinct vertices is $\\binom{12}{3} = 220$.\n\nFor $d(Q, R) = 2$ and $d(R, S) = 1$, we need to choose $R$ such that it has at least one neighbor that is not a neighbor of $Q$. There are 5 choices for $Q$, and for each $Q$, there are 4 choices for $R$ (since $R$ cannot be $Q$ or its 5 neighbors). For each $R$, there are 3 choices for $S$ (since $S$ cannot be $Q$, $R$, or the 5 neighbors of $R$). However, this overcounts the cases where $S$ is a neighbor of $Q$, so we subtract the cases where $S$ is a neighbor of $Q$. There are 5 such cases for each $Q$, so the total number of ways for this scenario is $5 \\times 4 \\times 3 - 5 \\times 5 = 60 - 25 = 35$.\n\nFor $d(Q, R) = 3$ and $d(R, S) = 1$ or 2, we need to choose $R$ such that it is not directly connected to $Q$ and has at least one neighbor that is not a neighbor of $Q$.

The number of possible values for the product is determined by the number of possible combinations of $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n\nFor each prime factor, the exponent can range from 0 to the maximum possible value that can be obtained by rolling $n$ dice. Specifically:\n- The exponent of 2, $a$, can range from 0 to $2n$ (since the maximum exponent of 2 in a single die roll is 2, and we roll $n$ dice).\n- The exponent of 3, $b$, can range from 0 to $n$ (since the maximum exponent of 3 in a single die roll is 1, and we roll $n$ dice).\n- The exponent of 5, $c$, can range from 0 to $n$ (since the maximum exponent of 5 in a single die roll is 1, and we roll $n$ dice).\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible values for the product is $(2n + 1) \\cdot (n + 1) \\cdot (n + 1) = (2n + 1) \\cdot (n + 1)^2$.

Then the expression inside the square root becomes \\(\\frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3}\\).\n\n2. **Determine the Domain:**\n   - The expression \\(\\frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3}\\) must be non-negative.\n   - The denominator \\(x - 3\\) must not be zero, so \\(x \\neq 3\\).\n   - We need to find the intervals where \\(\\frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3} \\geq 0\\).\n\n3. **Analyze the Sign of the Expression:**\n   - The numerator \\(2x - x^2 = x(2 - x)\\) is a parabola that opens downwards and has roots at \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 2\\).\n   - The denominator \\(x - 3\\) is zero at \\(x = 3\\).\n   - We need to check the sign of \\(\\frac{x(2 - x)}{x - 3}\\) in the intervals determined by these points: \\((-\\infty, 0)\\), \\((0, 2)\\), \\((2, 3)\\), and \\((3, \\infty)\\).\n\n4. **Determine the Intervals:**\n   - For \\(x \\in (-\\infty, 0)\\), the expression is negative.\n   - For \\(x \\in (0, 2)\\), the expression is positive.\n   - For \\(x \\in (2, 3)\\), the expression is negative.\n   - For \\(x \\in (3, \\infty)\\), the expression is positive.\n\n5. **Convert Back to \\(n\\):**\n   - Since \\(x = \\log(n)\\), we need \\(0 < \\log(n) < 2\\) or \\(\\log(n) > 3\\).\n   - This translates to \\(1 < n < 100\\) or \\(n > 1000\\).\n\n6. **Count the Integers:**\n   - The integers \\(n\\) in the range \\(1 < n < 100\\) are \\(2, 3, \\ldots, 99\\), which gives us \\(98\\) integers.\n   - The integers \\(n\\) in the range \\(n > 1000\\) are \\(1001, 1002, \\ldots\\), which is an infinite set.\n\nSince we are only considering the integers up to a reasonable limit for practical purposes (as the problem does not specify an upper bound), we will consider the integers from \\(2\\) to \\(99\\) and from \\(1001\\) to a reasonable upper limit, say \\(10000\\).\n\nLet's write the Python code to count these integers.\n\n```python\n# Count the integers in the range 2 to 99\ncount1 = len(range(2, 100))\n\n# Count the integers in the range 1001 to 10000\ncount2 = len(range(1001, 10001))\n\n# Total count\ntotal_count = count1 + count2\nprint(total_count)\n```"], "pred": ["2"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}
