A cubic trinomial in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) means that the highest degree of the terms involving \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) should be 3.\n\nLet's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the degree of each term in the expression \\(2x^2y^{|n|} - (n-1)y + 3\\):\n   - The degree of the term \\(2x^2y^{|n|}\\) is \\(2 + |n|\\).\n   - The degree of the term \\(-(n-1)y\\) is 1.\n   - The constant term 3 has degree 0.\n\n2. For the expression to be a cubic trinomial, the highest degree term must be 3. Since the term \\(-(n-1)y\\) has degree 1 and the constant term 3 has degree 0, the term \\(2x^2y^{|n|}\\) must have degree 3.

We need to check both values of \\(n\\) to see if they satisfy the condition of being a cubic trinomial:\n   - If \\(n = 1\\), the expression becomes \\(2x^2y^1 - (1-1)y + 3 = 2x^2y + 3\\), which is a cubic trinomial.\n   - If \\(n = -1\\), the expression becomes \\(2x^2y^1 - (-1-1)y + 3 = 2x^2y + 2y + 3\\), which is also a cubic trinomial.\n\n4. Since both \\(n = 1\\) and \\(n = -1\\) satisfy the condition, we can use either value to find the value of \\(3n^2 - 5n + 1\\):\n   - If \\(n = 1\\), then \\(3n^2 - 5n + 1 = 3(1)^2 - 5(1) + 1 = 3 - 5 + 1 = -1\\).\n   - If \\(n = -1\\), then \\(3n^2 - 5n + 1 = 3(-1)^2 - 5(-1) + 1 = 3 + 5 + 1 = 9\\).\n\nSince both values of \\(n\\) are valid, we need to check which one is the correct answer based on the problem statement.

Given the quadratic equation \\(2x^2 - (a-1)x + a = 0\\), we know that the roots are opposite in sign. Let's denote the roots by \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\). Since the roots are opposite in sign, their product must be negative. According to Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) is given by \\(\\frac{c}{a}\\). For our equation, the product of the roots is \\(\\frac{a}{2}\\). Since the roots are opposite in sign, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{2} < 0\n\\]\n\nThis implies that \\(a < 0\\). However, we also need to ensure that the quadratic equation has real roots. The discriminant of the quadratic equation \\(2x^2 - (a-1)x + a = 0\\) must be non-negative. The discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = (a-1)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot a = (a-1)^2 - 8a = a^2 - 2a + 1 - 8a = a^2 - 10a + 1\n\\]\n\nFor the quadratic equation to have real roots, we need:\n\n\\[\na^2 - 10a + 1 \\geq 0\n\\]\n\nWe can solve this inequality to find the range of \\(a\\).

Since we need to find the number that satisfies both conditions, we need to check which of these solutions is consistent with the original problem statement. The original problem states that the square root of a certain number is both \\(2m - 4\\) and \\(3m - 1\\), which means the number must be the same in both cases. Therefore, the correct number is 4, as it is the only number that satisfies both conditions when \\(m = 1\\).\n\nThus, the number is \\(\\boxed{4}\\)."], "pred": ["4"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}
