What types of force does Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibit?
What of the following is the right choice? Explain your answer.
(A) Article 2(4) encompasses only armed force
(B) Article 2(4) encompasses all types of force, including sanctions
(C) Article 2(4) encompasses all interference in the domestic affairs of States
(D) Article 2(4) encompasses force directed only against a State's territorial integrity
Solution:
The correct answer is:  

**(A) Article 2(4) encompasses only armed force.**  

### Explanation:  

Article 2(4) of the **United Nations Charter** states:  

*"All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations."*  

This provision **prohibits the use or threat of force** in international relations. However, based on state practice and legal interpretation, the term **"force"** in this context has been understood to refer **specifically to armed force** (such as military intervention, invasion, bombardment, or other acts involving military action).  

### Analysis of the Options:  

- **(A) Correct:** The prohibition in Article 2(4) is generally interpreted to apply to **armed force**, not economic or political measures.  
- **(B) Incorrect:** Article 2(4) does **not** encompass all types of force, such as **economic sanctions**, which are commonly used by the UN and states without violating the Charter.  
- **(C) Incorrect:** While the UN Charter supports **non-interference** in domestic affairs (see Article 2(7)), Article 2(4) is specifically about the **use of force**, not general interference.  
- **(D) Incorrect:** Article 2(4) prohibits force not only against a state's **territorial integrity** but also against its **political independence** or in ways inconsistent with UN purposes.  

Thus, **(A) is the best answer** because Article 2(4) primarily concerns **armed force**, excluding other forms of pressure like economic sanctions or political interference.

Final Answer: The final answer is (A). I hope it is correct.

Problem:
What is the judge ad hoc?
What of the following is the right choice? Explain your answer.
(A) If a party to a contentious case before the ICJ does not have a national sitting as judge, it is entitled to nominate someone as a judge solely for that case, with the title of judge ad hoc
(B) Judge ad hoc is the member of the bench of the ICJ with a casting vote
(C) Judge ad hoc is a surrogate judge, in case a judge is disqualified or passes away
(D) Judge ad hoc is the judge that each party will always nominate in every contentious case
Solution:
The correct answer is:  

**(A) If a party to a contentious case before the ICJ does not have a national sitting as judge, it is entitled to nominate someone as a judge solely for that case, with the title of judge ad hoc.**  

### Explanation:  
A **judge ad hoc** is a temporary judge appointed to the **International Court of Justice (ICJ)** when a party to a case **does not have a judge of its nationality on the bench**. This ensures **equality between the parties** in a dispute. The ICJ’s Statute allows each party to a case to have at least one judge of its nationality on the bench. If a party does not have a permanent judge of its nationality, it may appoint a judge ad hoc to sit only for that particular case.  

### Why the other choices are incorrect:
- **(B) Judge ad hoc is the member of the bench of the ICJ with a casting vote** → Incorrect. The **President of the ICJ** has the casting vote in case of a tie, not a judge ad hoc.  
- **(C) Judge ad hoc is a surrogate judge, in case a judge is disqualified or passes away** → Incorrect. If a judge is disqualified or passes away, a **replacement judge is chosen through other procedures**, but this does not make them a judge ad hoc.  
- **(D) Judge ad hoc is the judge that each party will always nominate in every contentious case** → Incorrect. A party only nominates a judge ad hoc if **it does not already have a national judge on the bench**. If a party already has a judge of its nationality, it **cannot** appoint a judge ad hoc.  

Thus, **option (A) is the correct choice**.

Final Answer: The final answer is (A). I hope it is correct.

Problem:
Would a reservation to the definition of torture in the ICCPR be acceptable in contemporary practice?
What of the following is the right choice? Explain your answer.
(A) This is an acceptable reservation if the reserving country's legislation employs a different definition
(B) This is an unacceptable reservation because it contravenes the object and purpose of the ICCPR
(C) This is an unacceptable reservation because the definition of torture in the ICCPR is consistent with customary international law
(D) This is an acceptable reservation because under general international law States have the right to enter reservations to treaties
Solution:
The correct choice is:  

**(B) This is an unacceptable reservation because it contravenes the object and purpose of the ICCPR.**  

### Explanation:  
Under Article 19 of the **Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT)**, a reservation to a treaty is impermissible if it is **incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty**. The **International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)** is a human rights treaty that aims to protect fundamental rights, including the prohibition of torture under **Article 7**.  

The prohibition of torture is considered a **peremptory norm (jus cogens)** in international law, meaning that no derogation or exception is allowed. A reservation that alters or weakens the definition of torture would undermine the ICCPR’s core purpose of protecting individuals from inhumane treatment.  

While **(C)** mentions that the definition of torture in the ICCPR aligns with **customary international law**, that alone does not make the reservation impermissible. The key reason why the reservation is invalid is that it undermines the **object and purpose** of the ICCPR, making **(B) the best answer**.

Final Answer: The final answer is (B). I hope it is correct.

Problem:
When 'consent' can serve as a circumstance precluding the wrongfulness of a State conduct?
What of the following is the right choice? Explain your answer.
(A) Consent can serve as a circumstance precluding the wrongfulness whenever it is given
(B) Consent can never serve as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness
(C) Consent can serve as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness, provided the consent is valid and to the extent that the conduct remains within the limits of the consent given
(D) Consent can always serve as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness, no matter which organ of the State gives it
Solution:
The correct answer is:  

**(C) Consent can serve as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness, provided the consent is valid and to the extent that the conduct remains within the limits of the consent given.**  

### Explanation:  
Under international law, particularly as reflected in **Article 20 of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA)**, the consent of a State can preclude the wrongfulness of an act that would otherwise violate international law. However, this is subject to two key conditions:  

1. **The consent must be valid** – It must be given by a competent authority of the State and not obtained through coercion, fraud, or in violation of fundamental norms (e.g., jus cogens).  
2. **The conduct must remain within the limits of the consent given** – If the act exceeds the scope of the consent, then it becomes wrongful.  

### Why the other options are incorrect:  
- **(A) Incorrect**: Consent is not always sufficient to preclude wrongfulness. It must meet the conditions of validity and scope.  
- **(B) Incorrect**: Consent can, under certain conditions, serve as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness.  
- **(D) Incorrect**: Not every organ of the State has the authority to provide consent that binds the State in international law. Only the competent authorities (e.g., government or relevant ministry) can validly do so.  

Thus, **(C) is the most accurate choice** based on international law principles.

Final Answer: The final answer is (C). I hope it is correct.

Problem:
How the consent to be bound of a State may be expressed?
What of the following is the right choice? Explain your answer.
(A) The consent of a State to be bound is expressed only by ratification
(B) The consent of a state to be bound by a treaty may be expressed by signature, ratification, acceptance, approval or accession
(C) The consent of a State to be bound is expressed by signature
(D) The consent of a State to be bound is expressed by whatever means they choose
Solution:
The correct answer is:  

**(B) The consent of a State to be bound by a treaty may be expressed by signature, ratification, acceptance, approval, or accession.**  

### Explanation:  
Under the **Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969)**, a State can express its consent to be bound by a treaty in several ways, including:  
- **Signature**: If the treaty provides that signature alone is sufficient for binding commitment.  
- **Ratification**: A formal process where a State confirms its consent after signing, typically requiring domestic approval (e.g., by a legislature).  
- **Acceptance & Approval**: These are alternative terms to ratification, often used in the same way but depending on a State’s internal processes.  
- **Accession**: A method for a State to join a treaty it did not originally sign, giving its consent later.  

### Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:  
- **(A) Only by ratification** → Incorrect. Treaties can allow other means like signature or accession.  
- **(C) Only by signature** → Incorrect. Many treaties require further steps like ratification.  
- **(D) Any means they choose** → Incorrect. The methods are defined by the treaty itself and international law, not just State discretion.  

Thus, (B) is the most legally accurate choice.

Final Answer: The final answer is (B). I hope it is correct."""
