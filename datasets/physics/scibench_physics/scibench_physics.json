Newton proposed a solution to this calculation by imagining that two wells be dug, one along the direction of high tide (our $x$-axis) and one along the direction of low tide (our $y$-axis). If the tidal height change we want to determine is $h$, then the difference in potential energy of mass $m$ due to the height difference is $m g h$. Let's calculate the difference in work if we move the mass $m$ from point $c$ to the center of Earth and then to point $a$. This work $W$ done by gravity must equal the potential energy change $m g h$. The work $W$ is\r\n$$\r\nW=\\int_{r+\\delta_1}^0 F_{T_y} d y+\\int_0^{r+\\delta_2} F_{T_x} d x\r\n$$. The small distances $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$ are to account for the small variations from a spherical Earth, but these values are so small they can be henceforth neglected. The value for $W$ becomes\r\n$$\r\n\\begin{aligned}\r\nW & =\\frac{G m M_m}{D^3}\\left[\\int_r^0(-y) d y+\\int_0^r 2 x d x\\right] \\\\\r\n& =\\frac{G m M_m}{D^3}\\left(\\frac{r^2}{2}+r^2\\right)=\\frac{3 G m M_m r^2}{2 D^3}\r\n\\end{aligned}\r\n$$\r\nBecause this work is equal to $m g h$, we have\r\n$$\r\n\\begin{aligned}\r\nm g h & =\\frac{3 G m M_m r^2}{2 D^3} \\\\\r\nh & =\\frac{3 G M_m r^2}{2 g D^3}\r\n\\end{aligned}\r\n$$\r\nNote that the mass $m$ cancels, and the value of $h$ does not depend on $m$.
