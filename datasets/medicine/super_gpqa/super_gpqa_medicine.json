The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 140/80 mm Hg; heart rate 59/min; respiratory rate 11/min; temperature 37.0°C (99.1℉), and SaO2, 95% on room air. The examination shows a laceration and bruising on the left side of the head. There is anisocoria with the left pupil 3 mm more dilated than the right. Both pupils react sluggishly to light. There is an increase in tone and hyperreflexia in the right upper and lower extremities. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, head elevated to 30°, and sent for a CT scan. Which of the following management strategies should be used in this patient, considering his most probable diagnosis?",

He says the painful oral lesions appeared about the same time as the rash. For the past 3 days, he also says he has been having double vision and dry, itchy eyes. He reports that he had a mild upper respiratory infection for a few days that preceded his current symptoms. The patient denies any chills, hematuria, abdominal or chest pain, or similar symptoms in the past. Past medical history is significant for a severe urinary tract infection diagnosed 3 weeks ago for which he has been taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The vital signs include: temperature 38.3°C (101.0℉), blood pressure 110/60 mm Hg, respiratory rate 20/min, and pulse 108/min. On physical examination, the patient has severe painful erosions of the oral mucosa. There are multiple fluid-filled vesicles and bullae averaging 3 mm in diameter with a surrounding erythematous ring that involve only the upper torso and extensor surfaces of upper extremities. Several of the lesions have ruptured, resulting in sloughing off of the epidermal layer. There is a prominent conjunctival injection present. Ophthalmic examination reveals mild bilateral corneal abrasions without any evidence of frank ulceration. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:\nWhite blood cell (WBC) count 8,500/mm3\nRed blood cell (RBC) count 4.20 x 106/mm3\nHematocrit 41.5%\nHemoglobin 14.0 g/dL\nPlatelet count 215,000/mm3\nC-reactive protein (CRP) 86 mg/L\nUrine and blood cultures are pending.

His pulmonary infiltrates had responded to appropriate intravenous antibiotics and his hypotension had responded to intravenous norepinephrine. Now the patient is alert and responsive to verbal commands, is afebrile with blood pressure of 114/74 but has not tolerated several trials of weaning from the ventilator. On physical examination, the patient is cooperative. Cranial nerves are normal. Muscle strength is poor, especially in distal musculature, where he displays only 2/5 strength in the hands and feet. Proximal strength is 3/5. Ankle and knee reflexes are unobtainable. Sensory examination is difficult because of problems communicating with the patient but suggests distal sensory loss in the lower extremities. Laboratory studies show that his creatinine level has spontaneously improved to 2.4 mg/dL. Electrolytes are normal, and the patient has a mild normochromic normocytic anemia with resolving leukocytosis. Serum creatine kinase is 78 units/L (normal <140).

He was at a restaurant, in general good health, enjoying a dinner with friends when the 1st symptoms started. He takes atorvastatin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and a multivitamin every day. A review of symptoms was negative. His symptoms spontaneously resolved after 5 minutes. In the emergency department, the vital signs included: blood pressure of 132/80 mm Hg, heart rate of 86/min, respiratory rate of 20/min, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. The laboratory results included:\nHemoglobin 11.3 g/dL\nHematocrit 33%\nWBC count 9,800/mm3\nPlatelet count 247,000/mm3\nInternational normalized ratio (INR) 1.1\nProthrombin time (PT) 11.5 seconds\nPartial thromboplastin time (PTT) 32 seconds\nHis electrocardiogram (ECG) and his head computed tomography (CT) scan were normal. A duplex ultrasound scan shows 70-89% stenosis in the left carotid artery and 50% in the right. In the course of evaluation, his aphasia recurred for 3 minutes. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was negative for areas of ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage. His symptom recurrence prompted his hospital admission for inpatient care. What is the next step in management?",

He says he has seen spots of blood on the toilet tissue but has not had any other noticeable bleeding. He reports no change in bowel habits and has not had recent fever, chills, or rectal drainage. He says he and his partner engage in anal-receptive intercourse. His most recent CD4+ T-lymphocyte count 2 months ago was 350/mm3 ; HIV viral load at that time was undetectable. He currently is being treated with antiretroviral therapy. He has had no opportunistic infections. Medical history is also significant for syphilis and genital herpes treated with penicillin and acyclovir, respectively. He does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcoholic beverages. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows small bilateral inguinal lymph nodes, but respiratory, cardiac, and abdominal examinations disclose no abnormalities. There are several tender fleshy lesions around the perianal area. Rectal examination produces tenderness, but there is no rectal discharge. Test of the stool for occult blood is trace positive.

During replication of these bacteria, the DNA strands are unwound at the origin of replication, forming two Y-shaped replication forks that open in opposite directions. At each replication fork, daughter strands are synthesized from the template strands in a 5′ to 3′ direction. On one strand, the DNA is synthesized continuously; on the other strand, the DNA is synthesized in short segments. The investigator finds that three enzymes are directly involved in elongating the DNA of the lagging strand in these bacteria.

He says he was previously healthy and active, hiking every weekend, but because of his increasing weakness and incoordination while walking, he stopped his weekly hiking excursion. His past medical history is unremarkable. Current medications are a daily multivitamin and occasional acetaminophen for headaches. He has no significant family history. The patient denies smoking, recreational drug use, or drinking. His vitals include: pulse 70/min, respirations 14/min, temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), and blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals fasciculations in the tongue and distal extremities. The left forearm shows significant atrophy, and mild lower limb muscle atrophy is also seen bilaterally. Hyporeflexia (1+) is present in the left arm, while hyperreflexia (3+) is seen in the legs bilaterally. Babinski's sign is positive bilaterally. The patient's speech is notably slow but no evidence of productive or expressive aphasia is present. The cranial nerves are intact.
