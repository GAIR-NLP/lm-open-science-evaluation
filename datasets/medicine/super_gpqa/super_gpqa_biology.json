        "question": "The Clark's Nutcracker (*Nucifraga columbiana*), the Pinyon Jay (*Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus*), and the Steller's Jay (*Cyanocitta stelleri*) are closely related species within the same family. The Clark's Nutcracker inhabits high-altitude regions and relies almost entirely on seeds stored during the autumn for its food supply in winter and spring, with each bird storing approximately 33,000 seeds annually. The Pinyon Jay is distributed in slightly lower-altitude areas and lives in social groups year-round. Each bird stores about 20,000 seeds annually, which constitute 70-90% of its winter diet. The Steller's Jay, residing in low-altitude regions, is the smallest in size and stores around 6,000 seeds per bird each year, accounting for 60% of its winter diet. If the three species are placed together in a small experimental area to store and retrieve seeds, what would the ranking of their memory abilities be from strongest to weakest?",
