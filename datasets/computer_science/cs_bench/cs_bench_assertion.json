    "Explanation": "According to the problem statement, the enqueue operation is performed at the end of the queue, which is the head of the linked list. It is clearly stated in the problem that the linked list only has a head pointer, meaning there is no head node or tail pointer. After enqueuing, the circular singly linked list must maintain its circular nature. The time complexity of finding the tail node in a circular singly linked list with only a head pointer is O(n), therefore the time complexity of the enqueue operation is O(n)."

    "Answer": "True",
    "Explanation": "The conversion rule from a forest to a binary tree is also \"left child, right sibling\". However, unlike ordinary trees, each tree in a forest is independent, so we first need to treat the root nodes of each tree as sibling nodes. Therefore, in the given problem, after the conversion of the forest, Tree 2 becomes the right subtree of the root node of Tree 1, and Tree 3 becomes the right subtree of the root node of Tree 2. Thus, the number of nodes on the right subtree of the root node of the binary tree corresponding to forest F is M_2 + M_3."

When using an adjacency list to perform breadth-first traversal on a graph, each vertex needs to be enqueued once (vertex list traversal), so the time complexity is O(n). In the process of searching for the adjacent vertices of all vertices, each edge is visited at least once (edge list traversal), thus the time complexity is O(e).

The following 8 bits (float type) 1000 1010 represent the exponent in excess-127 notation, so subtracting 0111 1111 yields the decimal number 11. In the IEEE 754 standard for single-precision floating-point numbers, there is an implied 1 in the mantissa when the exponent is non-zero. Therefore, the mantissa is (1.0010){B} = (1.125){D}, making the value of the number (+1.125)_{10}x2^11."

    "Explanation": "Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) utilizes the characteristic of capacitors to store charge for recording information. Due to the discharge of capacitors, it is necessary to recharge them before the charge is lost, which is known as refreshing. The method involves rewriting the original content at regular intervals, so the reading mentioned here does not involve transferring information into the CPU or from the CPU to the main memory. It simply reads the information out, passes it through a refresh amplifier, and then stores it back into the memory cell. The refresh amplifier is integrated on the RAM chip. Therefore, only one memory access occurs, which occupies a single access cycle. Statements II and IV are correct, while statements I and III are incorrect."

    "Question": "After adopting RISC technology, the computer architecture has returned to its early state.",
    "Answer": "False",
    "Explanation": "RISC selects some commonly used register-based instructions, not for compatibility with CISC; RISC cannot be compatible with CISC, so A is incorrect. RISC represents a change in CPU architecture that generally does not affect the overall structure of the computer, and even CPUs that utilize RISC technology cannot have an architecture as simple as in the early days, making B incorrect. RISC instructions are simple in functionality, and complex instructions are achieved through the combination of simple ones, which makes C incorrect; however, the main goal of RISC to reduce the number of instructions is correct."

In circuit switching, a dedicated communication path is established and maintained between the communicating parties until the communication session ends. This method is mainly used in traditional telephone networks. Circuit switching focuses on establishing and maintaining a continuous transmission path, rather than performing error detection and correction during transmission. Error control functions are typically implemented by higher-level protocols (such as transport layer protocols) rather than by circuit switching itself."

The specific method is as follows: at the transmitter, before a bit is added to the flag field, the hardware scans the bit stream, and whenever five consecutive \"1\" bits are detected, a \"0\" is inserted after them; at the receiver, the F field is located first to determine the boundary, then the bit stream within it is scanned, and whenever five consecutive \"1\" bits are found, the \"0\" following these five \"1\" bits is removed, thereby restoring the original bit stream."

The main function of a router is to forward data packets from one network to another based on the destination address. This process usually involves supporting and handling multiple network layer protocols, such as IPv4 and IPv6. Additionally, routers can use different routing protocols (such as RIP, OSPF, BGP) for route selection and can perform conversion and packet forwarding between different network layer protocols to ensure that data packets are correctly transmitted across different types of networks."

    "Answer": "True",
    "Explanation": "Using a priority-based + non-preemptive scheduling algorithm allows important jobs/processes to quickly receive system responses through high priority, while ensuring that less critical jobs/processes will not be indefinitely delayed in receiving system responses under non-preemptive scheduling. Such a balanced design is conducive to improving system response time. Increasing the time slice will delay the system response time: static paging management and reentrant code are unrelated to system response time."

    "Answer": "True",
    "Explanation": "When an interrupt or exception occurs, hardware implementation ensures that the CPU running in user mode is immediately switched to kernel mode. If the interrupt occurs while a user program is running, the system transitions from user mode to supervisor mode to handle the interrupt; if a low-level interrupt is interrupted, it remains in supervisor mode, as user programs can only run in user mode. Therefore, the program that enters the interrupt handling must be an OS program. The interrupt program itself may be a user program, but the interrupt handling program must be an OS program."

    "Question": "Process synchronization can be achieved without the need for semaphores.",
    "Answer": "False",
    "Explanation": "In multiprogramming, the semaphore mechanism is an effective tool for implementing process synchronization and mutual exclusion. The precedence relationship of process execution essentially refers to the synchronization relationship between processes. Besides, concurrent execution of processes does not require semaphore control, hence the correct answer is D."

    "Question": "When using the PV operation synchronization mechanism, the value range of semaphore S is 2, 1, 0, and -1.",
    "Answer": "True",
    "Explanation": "Since the program segment allows two processes to enter at a time, the maximum value of the semaphore is 2. With at most three processes applying, the minimum value of the semaphore is -1; therefore, the semaphore can take the values 2, 1, 0, -1."

    "Explanation": "When multiple processes are executed concurrently, the page tables of all processes mostly reside in memory. There is only one Page Table Register (PTR) set up in the system, which contains the starting address and the length of the page table in memory. Normally, when a process is not executing, the starting address and the length of the page table are stored in the process's own Process Control Block (PCB). These two pieces of data are loaded into the Page Table Register only when the process is scheduled. Each process has a separate logical address and its own page table."

However, there is another situation. For example, with the page sequence 1,2,3,1,2,3, there are 6 page faults when there are 2 page frames, and 3 page faults when there are 3 page frames.
