This item assesses the understanding of algorithm efficiency, where time complexity refers to asymptotic time complexity. Do not arbitrarily assign a special value to n; an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) is necessarily superior to one with a time complexity of O(2^n). Ⅲ. Time complexity always considers the worst-case time complexity to ensure that the running time of the algorithm will not exceed it. Ⅳ. This is a direct quote from the textbook by Wei-Min Yan. This issue has been discussed in forums for many years. For such efficiency issues at the language level, it is advised not to use specific example programs to explain their merits or demerits. Here, it is considered that this conclusion is correct."

Linked storage uses pointers to represent logical structures, and since the setting of pointers is arbitrary, it can conveniently represent various logical structures: Sequential storage can only use physical adjacency to represent logical structures, Ⅱ is correct. In sequential storage, inserting and deleting nodes requires moving a large number of elements, which is less efficient, and the description in Ⅲ is just the opposite.

According to the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, it is known that P_2 must be popped before P_1.

C does not have a corresponding sequence because when 4 is in the stack, it means that all previous elements (1, 2, 3) have been in the stack or have been pushed before. If 4 is the second to be popped, there are still two elements in the stack, which are ordered (according to the push sequence), and can only be (1,2), (1,3), or (2,3). If it is the sequence (1,2), then 2 and 3 have already been pushed and cannot be popped later.

        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "A Huffman tree typically refers to an extended binary tree with the minimum weighted path length. During its construction, two trees with the smallest root weights are selected each time, one as the left subtree and the other as the right subtree, to form a new binary tree. The weight of the new binary tree's root should be the sum of the weights of the root nodes of its left and right subtrees. As for which one becomes the left or right subtree, there is no restriction, so the constructed Huffman tree is not unique. Huffman trees only have nodes with degrees of 0 and 2, where nodes with degree 0 are external nodes with weights, and there are no nodes with a degree of 1."

        "Question": "The two core operations in a Union-Find set data structure are: ① Find, which determines whether two elements belong to the same set; ② Union, which merges two sets if the elements are not in the same set and the sets are disjoint. Assuming an initial disjoint-set of length 10 (0~9), and performing find and union operations in the sequence of 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 8-9, 1-8, 0-5, 1-9, the final number of sets in the disjoint-set is ().",

        "D": "The time complexity of the find operation in a union-find set of length n is O(log2n).",
        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "When implementing Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph using a disjoint-set data structure: before deciding whether to add an edge, first check if the two vertices connected by the edge belong to the same set (i.e., determine if adding this edge would form a cycle). If it forms a cycle, then continue to evaluate the next edge; if it does not form a cycle, then add the edge and its corresponding vertices to the minimum spanning tree T, and continue to evaluate the next edge, until all vertices have been added to T. B is correct. The method to determine the connectivity of an undirected graph using a disjoint-set is to traverse the edges of the graph, and for each edge encountered, merge the two vertices it connects into the same set. After processing all edges, vertices that are connected to each other will be merged into the same subset, while vertices that are not connected will definitely be in different subsets. C is correct. A disjoint-set data structure without path compression can have a height of O(n) in the worst case, where the time complexity of the find operation is O(n), and time complexity usually refers to the worst-case time complexity. D is incorrect."

Adjacency lists can be used to store undirected graphs by treating each edge as two directed edges with opposite directions, thus needing to be stored twice, which is incorrect for statement B. Since the elements below the diagonal in the adjacency matrix are all zeros, if there is an edge <i, j>, then it must be that i<j. By transitivity, it is known that the vertex numbers in the paths of the graph are in increasing order. Assuming there is a cycle k→...→j→k, according to the problem statement, it is known that k<j<k, which is a contradiction, hence cycles do not exist, and a topological ordering must exist, making statement C correct.

        "A": "Ⅰ,Ⅱ,Ⅳ",
        "B": "Ⅰ,Ⅲ,Ⅳ",
        "C": "Ⅰ,Ⅱ,Ⅲ",
        "D": "All possible",
        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Using depth-first traversal, if starting from a vertex u on a directed graph, an edge from vertex v to u appears before the end of DFS(u), since v is a descendant of u in the spanning tree, there must be a cycle in the graph that includes both u and v. Therefore, depth-first traversal can detect whether a directed graph has a cycle. During topological sorting, a vertex can only be added to the sequence when it is not the head of any edge. If there is a cycle, the vertices in the cycle are always the head of some edge and cannot be added to the topological sequence. In other words, if there are still vertices that cannot be found to be added to the topological sequence, it indicates that the graph has a cycle. Finding the shortest path allows the graph to have cycles. As for whether the critical path can determine if a graph has a cycle, there is some controversy. Although the critical path itself does not allow cycles, the algorithm for finding the critical path cannot determine whether there are cycles. Determining whether there are cycles is the first step in finding the critical path—topological sorting. Therefore, the answer to this question mainly depends on the perspective from which you approach the problem. Candidates need to understand the issue itself, as the real unified examination will not involve such ambiguous questions."

In the topological sorting algorithm, to temporarily store vertices with an in-degree of zero, a stack or a queue can be used.\nⅢ.

        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "In Ⅰ, for a directed graph that contains cycles, running the topological sorting algorithm will inevitably result in a subgraph with cycles where no nodes with an indegree of 0 can be found, thus preventing the continuation of the topological sort. In Ⅱ, note that if there is no ancestor or descendant relationship between two nodes, their order in the topological sequence is arbitrary (i.e., their precedence is arbitrary), so both stacks and queues can be used, as the nodes entering the stack or queue have an indegree of 0, and at this point, all nodes with an indegree of 0 are unrelated. Ⅲ is the challenging part; if the topological order sequence is unique, it naturally leads one to think of a linear directed graph (which is incorrect)."

However, the stem of the question has already specified an \"ordered topological sequence,\" so the correct choice should be C. It is important to note that if the adjacency matrix of a directed graph is a triangular matrix (with zero elements on the diagonal), then the graph must not contain any cycles, and therefore a topological sequence must exist."

        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Conflicts (collisions) are inevitable and are not related to the load factor; therefore, methods for handling conflicts need to be designed, Ⅰ incorrect. The idea of hash searching is to compute the hash address for searching and then compare the key to determine if the search is successful, Ⅱ incorrect. The average search length for a successful hash search is related to the load factor and is not related to the length of the table, Ⅲ incorrect. In the case of open addressing, one cannot arbitrarily delete an element from the hash table, as it may lead to the interruption of the search path (hence the common practice is to mark the spot for deletion instead of directly deleting it), Ⅳ correct."

        "Question": "The keys of the records after the first pass of 2-way merge sort are {25,50,15,35,80,85,20,40,36,70}, which include 5 sorted sublists of length 2. The result of the second pass of 2-way merge sort on this sequence is ().",

        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "Since a 2-way merge sort algorithm is used here, and it is the second pass of sorting, every 4 elements are merged together. The sequence can be divided into {25,50,15,35}, {80,85,20,40}, and {36,70}. After sorting them separately, we get {15,25,35,50}, {20,40,80,85}, and {36,70}. Therefore, option B is selected."

Direct insertion sort: each pass inserts one element, so the fixed number of passes is n-1; simple selection sort: each pass selects the smallest (or largest) element, so the fixed number of passes is n-1; radix sort: each pass involves \"distribution\" and \"collection,\" with the fixed number of passes being d."

        "Explanation": "Permutation-selection sort is a method used in external sorting to generate initial merge runs, which results in initial merge runs of unequal lengths. On average, the length of these runs is twice that of the traditional equal-length initial merge runs, thereby reducing the number of initial merge runs to nearly half of the original count.

        "Explanation": "The role of the optimal merge tree in external sorting is to design an optimized scheme for m-way merge sort. By emulating the construction of a Huffman tree, using the length of the initial merge segments as weights, an m-ary Huffman tree with the minimum weighted path length is constructed. This can effectively reduce the number of read and write operations during the merge process, thereby accelerating the speed of external sorting."

For instance, an m-way balanced merge requires m input buffers and 1 output buffer to hold the records participating in the merge and the records that have been merged. It can also be used as the workspace for internal sorting when generating initial merge segments. It does not have the task of conveying messages to the user interface."

For example, the one's complement representation 10010 stands for -13; shifting it right by 1 bit results in 11001, which is -6, affecting precision. Shifting it left by 1 bit results in 10101, which is -10, leading to data loss. In two's complement representation, the sign bit for positive numbers is 0, and when the leftmost bit shifted out is 0, there is no data loss; the sign bit for negative numbers is 1, and when the leftmost bit shifted out is 1, there is no data loss. Therefore, the most significant bit shifted out must be the same as the sign bit. II. In double sign bit representation, the highest sign bit represents the true sign, while the lower sign bit is used to participate in the shifting operation to determine if overflow occurs, for example, 01 indicates positive overflow, and 10 indicates negative overflow.

        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "Whether it is two's complement subtraction or unsigned number subtraction, it is implemented by adding the minuend to the two's complement of the subtrahend's negative. According to the complement formula, the two's complement of the negative of the subtrahend is [-y]_complement = Y + 1. Therefore, an inverter is used at the Y' input of the adder, and a control terminal Sub controls whether the bits of y are inverted before being input to the Y'' terminal, while Sub is also sent as the low-order carry into the adder. When Sub is 1, subtraction is performed; when Sub is 0, addition is performed. The binary number for 69 is 0100 0101; for subtraction with 38, the low-order carry is Sub, which is 1, and the binary number is 0010 0110, with all bits inverted to 1101 1001."

Assuming the instruction length is equal to the machine word length, the instruction fetch cycle is equal to the machine cycle II. Assuming the instruction word length is equal to the storage word length, the instruction fetch cycle is equal to the machine cycle III. The length of the instruction word length has no relation to the machine word length IV.

        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The instruction word length is generally an integer multiple of the storage word length. If the instruction word length is twice the storage word length, it requires two memory accesses, and the instruction fetch cycle is twice the machine cycle. If the instruction word length is equal to the storage word length, then the instruction fetch cycle is equal to the machine cycle; this statement is incorrect. According to the analysis of statement I, it is known that statement II is correct. The instruction word length depends on the length of the opcode, the length of the operand address, and the number of operand addresses, and is not necessarily related to the machine word length. However, for the convenience of hardware design, the instruction word length is generally taken as a byte or an integer multiple of the storage word length, so statement I is correct. According to the analysis of statement I, the instruction word length is generally a byte or an integer multiple of the storage word length, and is not necessarily the same size as the storage word length, therefore statement IV is incorrect. In summary, statements II and III are correct."

However, the breakpoint for an interrupt is the address of the next instruction (i.e., the PC value), so there is no need to recalculate the PC value."

        "D": "Division by zero",
        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "Page faults, address out-of-bounds, and division by zero are all faults that occur during the execution of an instruction, requiring the invocation of the corresponding exception handling routines in the operating system kernel to address them, whereas Cache misses are handled by the CPU hardware and do not require the invocation of an exception handler."

        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "A superscalar pipeline refers to a pipeline that can execute more than one instruction per clock cycle, thus A is correct. An instruction is divided into multiple stages, completed by different circuit units, so B is correct. Superscalar achieves simultaneous execution of multiple processors by incorporating multiple pipelines, essentially trading space for time, hence C is correct. Superscalar pipelines typically include the characteristic of parallel arithmetic operations, therefore D is incorrect."

        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "An m-stage pipeline can complete one instruction after one clock cycle, and with each subsequent clock cycle, it can complete another instruction.

        "Question": "The incorrect statement about program interrupt mode and DMA mode is ( )I. The priority of DMA is higher than that of program interrupts II. Program interrupt mode requires context saving, while DMA mode does not require context saving III. The interrupt request in program interrupt mode is to report the end of data transfer to the CPU, whereas the interrupt request in DMA mode is solely for data transfer.",

        "D": "I, III",
        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "DMA (Direct Memory Access) mode does not require CPU pre-transfer operations, only borrowing a little CPU time at the beginning and end, without occupying any other CPU resources. Interrupt mode involves program switching, where each operation requires saving and restoring the context, so DMA has a higher priority than interrupt requests, thereby speeding up processing efficiency. Therefore, statement I is correct. From the analysis, it is known that program interrupts require interrupting the current program, hence the need to save the context so that after the interrupt is completed, it can return to the original point to continue the unfinished work. DMA mode does not need to interrupt the current program and does not require saving the context, so statement I is correct. Statement II is just the opposite."

        "Question": "Among the following statements, the one that correctly describes the data encapsulation process in the OSI reference model is ().",
        "A": "The data link layer only adds the source physical address and destination physical address to the packet.",
        "B": "The network layer encapsulates the data generated by higher-level protocols into packets and adds third-layer addressing and control information.",
        "C": "The transport layer encapsulates the data stream into frames and adds reliability and flow control information.",
        "D": "The presentation layer segments the data generated by higher-level protocols into data segments and adds the corresponding source and destination port information.",
        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "The Data Link Layer, in addition to adding source and destination physical addresses to packets, also adds control information. The PDU of the Transport Layer is not called a frame; the Presentation Layer is not responsible for dividing the data generated by higher-level protocols into segments, and it is the Transport Layer that is responsible for adding the corresponding source and destination port information. Option B correctly describes the data encapsulation process in the OSI reference model; after passing through the Network Layer, only the third layer PCI is added."

The first interval is a high voltage level and the second interval is a low voltage level to represent bit 1, and it is the opposite for bit 0. The opposite convention can also be adopted, hence option D is incorrect. The transition in the middle of the bit serves as the clock signal, and the voltage level of each bit serves as the data signal, therefore option B is correct. Manchester encoding includes both the clock and data within the data stream, transmitting the clock synchronization signal along with the code information to the other party, thus option A is incorrect. Sound is analog data, while Manchester encoding is best suited for transmitting binary digital signals, therefore option C is incorrect."

        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "If a symbol can take 2^n different discrete values, it contains n bits of information. In this question, a symbol contains 2 bits of information. Since the baud rate numerically equals the bit rate divided by the number of bits per symbol, the baud rate is (64 / 2) k = 32kBaud."

        "C": "48kb/s",
        "D": "72kb/s",
        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "A noiseless signal should satisfy the Nyquist theorem, which states that the maximum data transmission rate = 2W log₂V bits/second. Substituting the data from the question, we get an answer of 48k bits/second, or 48kb/s. Note that the given sampling rate of 24k samples per second in the question is meaningless, as it exceeds the upper limit of the baud rate, 2W = 16kBaud, thus answer D is incorrect."

        "Explanation": "According to Shannon's theorem, the maximum data rate = W log₂(1 + S/N) = 4000 × log₂(1 + 127) = 28000 b/s. It is easy to mistakenly choose A for this question. However, note the restriction of \"binary signals\" in the question. According to Nyquist's theorem, the maximum data transfer rate = 2W log₂V = 2 × 4000 × log₂2 = 8000 b/s. Among the two upper limits, we take the smaller one, therefore the correct choice is B."

The frequency range of the 1 channel of analog signal is 0~1kHz, and each sampling point is encoded into a 4-bit binary number using PCM. The data rate of the other 7 channels of digital signals is 7.2kb/s each. The minimum communication capacity required for the multiplexed line is ( ).",

        "Explanation": "Channel 1 has a frequency of 1kHz, and the known frequency is 2kHz. Each code is a 4-bit binary number, so the data transmission rate is 8kb/s. The multiplexed rate for each branch must be equal, and the rates of the other 7 digital signals are all below 8kb/s. Therefore, they all need to use pulse stuffing to increase the data rate to 8kb/s. Then, by multiplexing these 8 signals, the required communication capacity is 8kb/s × 8 = 64kb/s."

        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "To prevent data loss during transmission, in reliable data link layer protocols, the sender sets a timer for each transmitted data frame. If the timer expires and the acknowledgment for that frame has not yet been received, the sender will retransmit the frame. To ensure that the receiver does not receive duplicate frames, each transmitted frame must be numbered; both Hamming codes and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) codes are used for error control."

        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Unacknowledged connectionless service refers to the scenario where the source machine sends independent frames to the destination machine, which does not acknowledge these frames. No logical connection is established beforehand, nor is it necessary to release a logical connection afterwards. If a frame is lost due to noise on the line, the data link layer will not detect such an occurrence, nor will it respond. This type of service is very suitable when the error rate is very low. In such cases, the recovery task can be left to the higher layers. This service is also very appropriate for real-time communication, as in real-time communication, the lateness of data is worse than data corruption."

        "Explanation": "To successfully send a network layer packet, 10 data link layer frames need to be successfully transmitted. The probability of successfully transmitting 10 data link layer frames is (0.95)^10 ≈ 0.598, which means there is only about a 60% success rate. This conclusion demonstrates that the efficiency of unacknowledged services over unreliable channels is very low. To improve reliability, acknowledged services should be introduced."

        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "A wireless local area network (WLAN) cannot simply use the CSMA/CD protocol, particularly the collision detection part, for the following reasons: Firstly, on a WLAN adapter, the strength of the received signal is often much lower than the strength of the transmitted signal. Therefore, implementing collision detection would incur excessive hardware costs. Secondly, in a WLAN, not all stations can hear each other, leading to hidden and exposed station problems. The requirement that 'all stations can hear each other' is a fundamental basis for implementing the CSMA/CD protocol."

        "Explanation": "There are generally three methods to segment VLANs. 1. Based on ports, several ports of a switch are grouped into a logical set; this method is the simplest and most effective. If a host leaves its original port, it may enter a new subnet. 2. Based on MAC addresses, hosts are divided into a subnet according to their MAC addresses; when a host physically moves from one switch to another, it still belongs to the original subnet. 3. Based on network layer addresses, VLANs are segmented according to network layer addresses or protocols, allowing VLANs to extend across routers and connect hosts from multiple local area networks."

However, routers cannot process the protocol data above the network layer, so the higher-level protocols above the network layer must be the same. It is easy to mistakenly choose option B, mainly because the TCP/IP protocol suite is widely used in the current internet, and IPv4 is commonly used at the network layer, leading to the misconception that the network layer protocols must be the same. In reality, using specific routers to connect IPv4 and IPv6 networks is a typical example of different network layer protocols being used to achieve connectivity."

Dynamic routing, on the other hand, automatically discovers and maintains routing information through routing protocols, can adapt to changes in network status promptly, and is complex with high overhead.

        "Question": "A certain unit has been allocated a Class B address and plans to divide its internal network into 35 subnets, with the possibility of adding 16 more subnets in the future. Each subnet should support close to 800 hosts. The feasible mask scheme is ( ).",

        "D": "255.255.255.0",
        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "Before subnetting, a Class B address has 16 bits for the host portion. Since there is a need to create 35+16=51 subnets, 2^5<51<2^6, it is necessary to allocate 6 bits from the host portion for the subnet number, leaving 10 bits for hosts, which allows for 2^{10}, or 1024 hosts, meeting the requirements of the problem. Therefore, a viable mask scheme is 255.255.252.0."

        "Question": "When hosts in different subnets communicate with each other, the correct statement among the following is ( )",

        "C": "When a router forwards an IP datagram, it re-encapsulates the destination hardware address and the destination IP address.",
        "D": "The source site can directly perform ARP broadcast to obtain the hardware address of the destination site.",
        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "An IP datagram header contains both the source IP address and the destination IP address, but routing decisions are made based solely on the destination IP address during communication. As the IP datagram travels through the network, the source IP address and destination IP address in the header remain unchanged when passing through routers. ARP broadcasts are only propagated within a subnet; since the communicating hosts are not on the same subnet, the destination station's hardware address cannot be obtained directly through ARP broadcasts. Hardware addresses are only locally significant, so each time a router forwards an IP datagram to a specific network, it must re-encapsulate the source hardware address and the destination hardware address. Note: Upon receiving a packet, the router strips off the data link layer protocol header of that packet and then adds a new data link layer protocol header before the packet is forwarded."

        "D": "The main requirement is to send information, but the ARP table already contains a mapping relationship between the destination IP address and the MAC address.",
        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "When the source host wants to send an IP datagram to a host on the local LAN, it first checks its ARP cache for a mapping of the destination IP address to a MAC address. If there is a mapping, the hardware address is written into the MAC frame, which is then sent to the destination hardware address through the LAN. If there is no mapping, an ARP request packet is broadcasted first, and after receiving the ARP reply packet from the destination host, the mapping of the destination host's IP address to its hardware address is written into the ARP cache. If the destination machine is not on the local LAN, the IP packet is sent to the router on the local LAN, and of course, the mapping of the router's IP address to its hardware address must be obtained in the same way."

In the client/server model, the requests between them are very short, and using UDP is not only simple in coding but also requires very few messages. The reasons for using UDP in remote procedure calls are the same as in the client/server model. For real-time multimedia applications, it is important to ensure timely data delivery, and minor errors are tolerable, so using UDP is also appropriate. However, remote login relies on a reliable connection, and using UDP is not suitable."

        "Explanation": "In the slow start and congestion avoidance algorithms, the congestion window initially starts at 1, and the window size begins to grow exponentially. When the congestion window exceeds the slow start threshold, the slow start algorithm is no longer used, and the congestion avoidance algorithm is adopted instead. The initial threshold value for slow start is set to 8, and the congestion avoidance algorithm is used when the congestion window size reaches 8, with the window size increasing linearly by one segment each time. When the window size reaches 12, a timeout occurs, and the threshold is reset to 6 (half of 12), with the congestion window being reset to 1 and the slow start algorithm being executed again. Once the threshold of 6 is reached, the congestion avoidance algorithm is used. Thus, the changes in the congestion window size are as follows: 1,2.4,8,9,10,11,12,1,2,4,6,7,8,9…, with the congestion window size being 7 during the 13th transmission."

        "Question": "A host machine looking to resolve the IP address for www.baidu.com, if configured with the domain name server 202.120.66.68, the internet top-level domain server at 11.2.8.6, and the domain name server holding the IP address mapping for www.baidu.com at 202.113.16.10, would typically first query ().",

        "D": "You may choose any one from these three domain name servers.",
        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "When this host sends a DNS query message for www.baidu.com, the query message is first sent to the host's local domain name server at 202.120.66.68. If the local domain name server cannot immediately respond to the query, it will query a root domain name server as a DNS client. However, regardless of the method of query, the local domain name server must be queried first."

        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The user agent receives emails using the POP3 protocol. Typically, when configuring an email user agent, it is necessary to set the mail server's POP3 address (such as pop3.gmail.com). If this address is set incorrectly, it will result in the user being unable to receive emails. An incorrect SMTP address in the user agent will lead to the inability to send emails, and an incorrect recipient E-mail address may result in sending to the wrong person or delivery failure (non-existent address)."

        "D": "An account can only have one mail receiving directory on the server.",
        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "The POP3 protocol uses plaintext for password transmission at the transport layer and does not encrypt the password, so option B is incorrect.

Of course, readers can also use the previously mentioned \"cup\" example to think about how to rule out options A, B, and C. When the operating system manages memory, it deals with issues such as where data in memory is placed, where data can be placed, where data cannot be placed (memory protection), and where there is free space. However, what the data in memory is, and how to read and write it, are not concerns of kernel mode. It's like the operating system manages where cups are placed, which cups' water can be drunk, and which cups' water cannot be drunk, but whether the cup contains water or a beverage, and whether you pick up the cup to drink or insert a straw to sip, are not concerns of the operating system. The \"cup\" example can help us accurately understand the tasks of the operating system, and many issues in subsequent chapters will become very clear when compared using this example."

In a layered OS, adding or replacing a module or an entire layer does not affect other layers as long as the interfaces between the corresponding layers remain unchanged, making it easy to expand and maintain. Once the hierarchy is defined, the dependencies between the layers are also set, which often results in a lack of flexibility, hence option C is incorrect. Executing a function typically requires traversing through multiple layers from top to bottom, which adds extra overhead and leads to reduced system efficiency."

Microkernel architecture lacks a single stable kernel Ⅳ. Makes the system more reliable",

        "Explanation": "Microkernel architecture requires frequent switching between kernel mode and user mode, leading to relatively high execution overhead for the operating system. The operating system code that is moved out of the kernel is divided into several service programs according to the principle of layering. Their execution is independent of each other, and interactions are facilitated through the microkernel for communication, which affects the system's efficiency; therefore, 1 is not an advantage. Since the number of services provided by the kernel is reduced, and generally speaking, the fewer services the kernel provides, the more stable it is, so Ⅲ is incorrect. However, Ⅱ and Ⅳ are indeed the advantages of microkernel architecture."

Consequently, if one thread of the process is blocked, the entire process is blocked, and naturally, all other threads of the process are also blocked.

        "Explanation": "It is necessary to understand the situations where process scheduling and switching cannot be performed (during interrupt handling, accessing critical sections, atomic operations), as well as the situations where process scheduling and switching should be carried out. A running process can activate the scheduler for rescheduling due to reasons such as the exhaustion of its time slice, completion of execution, waiting for an event to occur (such as waiting for keyboard input), errors, or self-blocking. This leads to the selection of a new ready process to be put into execution. The addition of a new process to the ready queue is not a direct cause for scheduling; when the CPU is running other processes, the new process still needs to wait. Even in systems that use high-priority scheduling algorithms, when a highest-priority process enters the ready queue, it is necessary to consider whether preemption is allowed. If preemption is not allowed, the process must still wait."

        "Explanation": "The process state diagram shows that the more processes are ready, the more competition there is for the CPU. However, as long as the ready queue is not empty, the CPU can always schedule processes to run and remain busy. This is independent of the number of ready processes, unless the ready queue is empty, at which point the CPU enters a wait state, resulting in reduced CPU efficiency."

Upon awakening, the priority of a process can increase under certain circumstances, but it generally does not become the highest. Instead, it is calculated by a fixed algorithm. The process will not be placed at the head of the ready queue after being awakened; its position in the ready queue is assigned according to certain rules, such as first-come-first-served, priority-based, or shortest-job-first, etc. It cannot directly take control of the processor to run."

        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "The timing of process scheduling is related to the characteristics of the process, such as whether the process is CPU-bound or I/O-bound, its own priority, etc. However, these characteristics alone are not sufficient. Whether a process can be scheduled also depends on the process scheduling policy. If a priority scheduling algorithm is used, then the process's priority becomes effective. As for the duration of processor occupation, it depends on the process itself. If the process is I/O-bound, it will frequently access I/O ports during execution, which means it may often relinquish the CPU, so it will not occupy the CPU for a long time. Once it gives up the CPU, it must wait for the next scheduling. If the process is CPU-bound, once it occupies the CPU, it may run for a long time. However, the running time also depends on the process scheduling policy. In most cases, interactive systems, to improve user response time, mostly adopt the round-robin algorithm with time slices. This algorithm forces a process to be switched out after it has occupied the CPU for a certain amount of time, to ensure the CPU usage rights of other processes. Therefore, choose C."

CPU-bound jobs refer to those that require a significant amount of CPU time for computation and seldom request I/O operations; thus, using FCFS allows them to complete computations with ease. I/O-bound jobs, on the other hand, frequently request I/O operations during CPU processing, resulting in the need to re-queue and wait for scheduling after operations are completed. Therefore, CPU-bound jobs are closer to long jobs, and if FCFS is used, the waiting time can be excessively long. The Round-Robin scheduling method assigns the same time slice to both short and long jobs, so their status is almost equal. Priority scheduling favors processes with higher priorities, and priority is not necessarily related to the length of the job time. Therefore, option B is selected."

        "Question": "Among the following statements, the correct one(s) is (are) (). Ⅰ. The time slice of a time-sharing system is fixed, so the more users there are, the longer the response time. Ⅱ. UNIX is a powerful multi-user, multitasking operating system that supports multiple processor architectures and is classified as a time-sharing operating system according to the categorization of operating systems. Ⅲ. The interrupt vector address is the entry address of the interrupt service routine. Ⅳ. When an interrupt occurs, the program counter (PC) is protected and updated by hardware, not by software, mainly to improve processing speed.",

        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Option Ⅰ is correct. In a time-sharing system, the response time is directly proportional to the time slice and the number of users. Option Ⅱ is correct. Option Ⅲ is incorrect; the interrupt vector itself is used to store the entry address of the interrupt service routine, hence the address of the interrupt vector should be the address of that entry. Option Ⅳ is incorrect; interrupts are protected and completed by hardware, mainly to ensure the system operates reliably and correctly. Improving processing speed is also a benefit, but it is not the primary purpose. In summary, options Ⅲ and Ⅳ are incorrect."

In this question, the restrictive relationship between the two processes is synchronization, where process B can only read data from the buffer after process A has placed the data into the buffer. Additionally, the shared buffer must be accessed mutually exclusively, so they also have a mutual exclusion relationship."

        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "The directed edge from a process to a resource is called a request edge, and the directed edge from a resource to a process is called an allocation edge. Option A is incorrect; a rectangular box represents a resource, with dots inside indicating the number of resources, so option B is incorrect; a circular node represents a process, which means option C is incorrect; the statement in option D is correct."

        "C": "Hold and wait for resources",

        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "The so-called violation of mutual exclusion of resources refers to allowing multiple processes to access resources simultaneously. However, some resources, such as printers, can only be used exclusively. Therefore, the method of preventing deadlock by violating the mutual exclusion condition is not very feasible, and in some cases, this exclusivity should be protected. The other three conditions can be realized."

        "Explanation": "Not all unsafe states are deadlock states, but once the system enters an unsafe state, it may progress into a deadlock state; conversely, as long as the system is in a safe state, it can avoid entering a deadlock state; a deadlock state is necessarily an unsafe state."

        "Question": "The system adopts the following resource allocation strategy: If a process's resource request cannot be satisfied and there are no processes currently blocked due to waiting for resources, then it will block itself. However, if there are already processes blocked due to waiting for resources, it will check all processes that are blocked due to waiting for resources. If they have the resources needed by the requesting process, these resources will be taken and allocated to the requesting process. This allocation strategy can lead to ().",

        "C": "rollback",
        "D": "Hunger",
        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "A process actively releasing resources will not lead to a deadlock because it breaks the hold-and-wait condition, so option A is incorrect. Thrashing, also known as jitter, is a phenomenon caused by improper page scheduling in a demand paging system, which will be discussed in the next chapter; for now, we can conclude that option B is incorrect. Rollback refers to reverting from the current state to the state one minute ago. If resource X was owned one minute ago and has possibly been released, then it is not a return to the state one minute ago, and thus not a rollback, making option C incorrect. Because a process is too \"generous,\" constantly giving away resources it has acquired to others, resulting in its own long-term inability to complete tasks, this is starvation, making option D correct."

        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "I correct. II correct: These are the two main reasons for deadlock occurrence. III correct: When resources are allocated in an ordered manner, there is no possibility of a circular chain among processes, meaning no circular wait can occur. IV correct: The resource preemption method allows a process to forcibly take over the system resources held by other processes. Similarly, aborting a process forcibly releases the system resources held by a process. Both approaches resolve deadlock by breaking the \"hold and wait\" condition, therefore the answer is D."

In contrast, the paging storage management scheme divides the program into several pages (blocks) discretely, allowing the program to be loaded into non-contiguous memory spaces. Clearly, static relocation cannot meet this requirement."

        "Question": "In a virtual paging storage management system, if the page accessed by a process is not in the main memory and there are no free frames available in the main memory, the correct sequence of system handling is ().",

        "D": "Page Fault → Page Replacement Decision → Page In → Page Out",
        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "According to the process of handling page faults, after a page fault occurs, the first step is to look for a free physical block in memory. If there are no free physical blocks available, a page replacement algorithm is used to determine which page to evict. Then, the evicted page is swapped out, followed by the swapping in of the page that the process intends to access. The entire process can be summarized as: page fault → determine page to evict → page swap out → page swap in."

        "Question": "Given that the system uses a 32-bit physical address and a 48-bit virtual address, with a page size of 4KB and a page table entry size of 8B. Assuming the system employs pure paging, it will use a ()-level page table, and the page offset is () bits.",

        "C": "4, 12",
        "D": "4, 14",
        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "The page size is 4KB, so the offset within a page is 12 bits. The system uses a 48-bit virtual address, so the virtual page number is 48-12=36 bits. When using a multi-level page table, the highest-level page table entries must not exceed one page size: the number of page table entries that can be accommodated per page is 4KB/8B=512=2^9, and 36/9=4, so a 4-level page table should be used. The highest-level page table entries exactly occupy one page space, thus the correct answer for this question is C."

The Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm does not produce Belady's anomaly, so statement Ⅱ is incorrect. If a page is in memory, it will not cause a page fault, meaning there will be no page swapping in/out, as opposed to virtual memory (including the part of the hard disk that acts as virtual memory), thus statement Ⅲ is incorrect and statement Ⅳ is correct."

        "D": "II, IV",
        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "I Correct: Increase the capacity of memory. Increasing memory allows each program to have more page frames, which can reduce the page fault rate, thereby reducing the swapping in/out process and improving CPU utilization.\n\nII Incorrect: Increase the capacity of the disk swap area. Since the system is already in a frequent swapping in/out process, it is not due to the lack of capacity in the disk swap area, therefore increasing its capacity is useless.\n\nIII Correct: Reduce the degree of multiprogramming. This can improve CPU utilization because, given the condition that the disk swap area utilization is 99.7%, it indicates that the system is already in a frequent swapping in/out process, which can reduce the number of programs in the main memory.\n\nIV Incorrect: Increase the degree of multiprogramming. As the system is in a frequent swapping in/out process, adding more user processes to the main memory will only lead to more frequent swapping in/out, worsening performance.\n\nV Incorrect: Use a faster disk swap area. Since the system is already in a frequent swapping in/out process, even with a faster disk swap area, the frequency of swapping in/out will not change, therefore it is useless.\n\nVI Incorrect: Use a faster CPU. As the system is in a frequent swapping in/out process and the CPU is idle with low utilization, increasing the CPU speed is of no help.\n\nIn summary, I and III can improve CPU utilization."

        "A": "Each record in the index table can have multiple index entries.",
        "B": "When accessing an indexed file, it is necessary to first search the index table.",
        "C": "The index table contains data of the index files and their physical addresses.",
        "D": "One of the purposes of creating an index is to reduce storage space.",
        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "An index file consists of a logical file and an index table. When accessing an index file, the index table must be searched first. Each index entry contains only the length of the record and its starting position in the logical file. Since each record must have an index entry, this increases the storage cost."

        "C": "Index structure",
        "D": "Hash structure",
        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The requirement for continuous storage space means that the size of the file must be known in advance, so that a sufficiently large storage area can be found in the storage space based on its size. If the file grows dynamically, the space it occupies will become increasingly large. Even if the final size of the file is known beforehand, the method of pre-allocating storage space is very inefficient, as it results in a large amount of storage space being idle for a long time."

        "Question": "Assuming a log file that uses linked allocation, with a fixed logical record length of 100B, and employs record clustering technique for storage on disk. The disk block size is 512B. If the directory entry for the file has already been loaded into memory, then after modifying the 22nd logical record, the disk is accessed () times.",

        "C": "5",
        "D": "6",
        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "The 22nd logical record is stored in the 5th physical block (22x100/512=4, remainder 152). Since the file uses a linked file physical structure, it is necessary to start reading from the first physical block pointed to by the directory entry, which requires initiating the disk 5 times. After modification, a write-back operation is also needed. Since the physical address of the block has already been obtained during the write-back, the disk only needs to be initiated once. Therefore, a total of 6 disk initiations are required."

        "A": "In the index file, each entry in the index table contains the key of the corresponding record and the physical address where the record is stored.",
        "B": "When retrieving a sequential file, the first step is to read the first block number of the file from the FCB; whereas, when retrieving an indexed file, one should first read the starting address of the file index block from the FCB.",

        "D": "When dealing with large files, whether performing sequential access or random access, using an indexed file method is usually the fastest.",
        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "The entries in the index table contain the key of the corresponding record and the logical address where the record is stored; a three-level index requires four disk accesses; index files are fast for random access, while sequential files are fast for sequential access."

        "Explanation": "The number of disk blocks occupied by 3200 directory entries is 3200x64B/1KB=200 blocks. Since the average number of disk accesses for a single-level directory is 1/2 the number of blocks (sequentially searching through all the directory entries in the directory table, with each entry being an FCB), the average number of disk accesses is 200/2=100 times."

        "A": "Due to the faster retrieval speed of hashing, modern operating systems have replaced the traditional sequential search method with it.",
        "B": "When using the sequential search method, the file's pathname should be used for the tree directory, and the search should start from the root directory and proceed level by level.",
        "C": "When using the sequential search method, the search should be stopped as soon as one component of the pathname is not found.",
        "D": "After completing the search using the sequential search method, the physical address of the file can be obtained.",
        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "To implement user access to files by name, the system first uses the filename provided by the user to form a search path and searches the directory. In sequential search, if a component of the pathname is not found, it indicates that a certain directory or file in the pathname does not exist, and there is no need to continue the search, so C is correct. There are two methods for directory querying: sequential search and hash method. Sequential search is usually used, so A is incorrect. In a tree-structured directory, to speed up file searching, a current directory can be set, so the file path can start from the current directory, which makes B incorrect. After the sequential search is completed, the result is the logical address of the file, which makes D incorrect."

        "Answer": "B",

Therefore, block number 100 is in row number 4. Next, determine the column of block number 100 in row number 4. The first column in row number 4 is block number 97, and so on, block number 100 is in the fourth column of row number 4. Alternatively, the row number row and column number col can be calculated as row=(100-1)DIV32+1=4, col=(100-1) MOD32+1= 4, which means the row and column numbers are both 4. Note that if it is specified that row and column numbers start from 0, then the answer would be different."

Each character print interrupt requires 50μs of CPU time, so the system overhead for interrupts per second is 400x50μs=20ms.

        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "The total time taken to process the data assumes that buffer 1 has already transferred the data to the user area by default. Then, we discuss the scenarios: if T_3 > T_1, meaning the CPU processes the data block slower than the data transfer, it implies that the I/O device can input continuously. The disk transfers data to the buffer and then to the user area, which can be considered as parallel processing with the CPU data processing. The time spent depends on the maximum time consumed by the CPU, so the total time used by the system is T_3. If T_3 < T_1, meaning the CPU processes data faster than the data transfer, the CPU does not need to wait for the I/O device. The disk transfers data to the buffer, and the transfer of data from the buffer to the user area and the CPU data processing can be considered as parallel operations. Thus, the time spent depends on the time T_1 taken by the disk to transfer data to the buffer. Therefore, the correct choice is D."

        "Question": "Among the following statements about rotational latency, the incorrect one is ().",
        "A": "The magnitude of rotational latency is independent of the disk scheduling algorithm.",
        "B": "The magnitude of rotational latency depends on the disk's free space allocation program.",
        "C": "The magnitude of rotational latency is related to the physical structure of the file.",
        "D": "The processing time for sector data has a significant impact on rotational latency.",
        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Disk scheduling algorithms are designed to reduce seek time. The processing time of sector data mainly affects the transfer time. Options B and C are both related to rotational latency. The physical structure of a file corresponds to the method of disk space allocation, including contiguous allocation, linked allocation, and indexed allocation. In disks with contiguous allocation, the physical addresses of files are consecutive; whereas in disks with linked allocation, the physical addresses of files are non-consecutive, thus both are related to rotational latency."

        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "The disk's rotational speed is 7200 RPM (revolutions per minute) = 120 RPM (revolutions per second), passing through 160 sectors per revolution, with each sector being 512B. Therefore, the data transfer rate = 120 x 160 x 512 / 1024 KB/s = 9600 KB/s."
